## Reflection:

This assignment has been my least favorite so far in the semester. It felt SOOOOOOO long. If we had built in tests my heart would sing, but alas, I struggled through it. 

To start, Anh and I split up the work so that she worked on doubly linked lists and I worked on singly linked lists. I thought mine would be easier since I wouldn’t have to account for the previous links, but alas, that was not the case. 

When I started, phase one was pretty much fine. However, to be totally honest, I wasn’t feeling great about implementing a generic class because I didn’t have a ton of practice (which is probably all the more reason for me to test it out here!). 

After phase one, I ran into problems with phase 2 because I kept forgetting the cases in which you have to update the head and tail. I also messed up some of the tests because I didn’t properly update the tail and thus the toString method I made also did not work (because of this.tail). Thank god the TAs were there to spot it and had dealt with the issue before. 

Finally, for phase 3, I had felt confident enough in all of my practice from the previous 2 phases that I actually got all my logic on the first try (with the exception of that tail problem I mentioned previously). I also had a bit of difficulty with the tests, but when Anh and I met for one last time we were able to debug everything fairly easily (it was just VERY tedious). 

Overall, this assignment was not my favorite. I think that the experience of going through the phases was very helpful, but I really wish there were built in classes because otherwise it felt like very tedious and exhausting work.

I’d also like to note that this week I am feeling much more confident in my coding skills after having taken the midterm. Making my study sheet has really helped me understand everything and how it all connects which is a really important piece of my learning for this course.
